# App Idea: Pomodoro App

This is an app that allows you to study using the Pomodoro Technique. You can set how long you want to study for and how long your breaks are. I would like to implement a feature to track the length of your focus time and breaks, as well as your total study time over the course of weeks. I want to implement graphs to show trends over time so the user can use the information to manage their time more effectively.
